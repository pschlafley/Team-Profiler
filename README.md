  After you clone the starter code and make sure you have all of the required software installed on your machine. You then need to open the code in your code editor, then in the root directory of your project, open the terminal and then run the command node index.js. When you run that command you will then be prompted through each question pertaining to the specific type of employee that you want to enter in. Then all you need to do after you answer each question is go to the generated index.html file in the dist folder and open the file in the default browser!
